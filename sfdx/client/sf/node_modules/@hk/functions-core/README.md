# @salesforce/functions-core

Library for interacting with Salesforce Functions.

This library is very much a work-in-progress, but will evolve over time to cover the full range
of functonality available when working with Salesforce Functions.

Currently, this library exposes:

- `generateProject`
- `generateFunction`
- a custom error class (`FunctionsError`).
- `Benny` a class for interacting with github.com/heroku/benny and running
  functions in a local container.
- `LocalRun` a class for running functions on the local host.
- `runFunction` for sending data to a running function.
